				<p> This is my home screen where I will put my stuff which is top hit from all sections.<br>
				In this section I will do something different from other section in terms of User Interface.<br>
				There will be sliders containing top stories from each section, but I must be extra careful in these<br>
				sliders because I want to make my blog a very light weight and designed with minimalist approach.

				<p>This section of my blog will be dedicated to stories from political field.<br>
				Whatever comments and stories I will published from political point of view will be<br>
				placed here. There would be lot of political stories in this section, that's why<br>
				I placed this section second to Home Section.<br>

				<p>As I am tech enthusiast, So I like to write a lot about technology and various trends in fields of science<br>
				I am writing tech stuff from previous two years and I am publishing it through a blog named<br>
				as Free and Open Source Technology hosted at blogspot. Main areas about which I write is open source technology<br>

				<p>
				I am quite hesitant about talking myself but given some recent changes in my life<br>
				I was forced to think that incidents that I have experienced may be useful or amusing to others<br>
				So I took it as a challenge and would start writing about myself very soon.<br>

				<div id="misc">MISCELLANEOUS
				<p> There are many topics on which I write about and these topics do not fall under any<br>
				category defined as above. So I thought that it would be better to put them in this section. <br>
				This may contain various topics like books, fiction, any special incidents or various irrelevant topics like weather<br>
				or symbology.<br>
