Blog
This is the code for my personal blog. This is created using the angular js.

Content of this blog is coming from json file, which is placed on the dynamically using the angular js.

Link page that is opening after clicking the "Read More" link is a single on which content is coming by
detecting the id of intended page using ng-click, then retrieving the content of that page using angular js.
